# Vercel Deployment Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. **Project Structure Issue**
**Problem:** The application code was located in a `crunchem` subdirectory, but Vercel was trying to build from the root directory.

**Solution:** Created a `vercel.json` configuration file in the root directory with proper build commands that navigate to the `crunchem` directory.

### 2. **Vite Configuration Conflicts**
**Problem:** Multiple TypeScript and dependency version conflicts:
- `vite-plugin-source-info` was incompatible with Vite 6
- `@vitejs/plugin-react` v4 was incompatible with Vite 6
- `vitest/config` import was causing type conflicts

**Solutions:**
- Removed `vite-plugin-source-info` from dependencies
- Updated `@vitejs/plugin-react` from v4 to v5
- Separated Vite and Vitest configurations into separate files
- Created standalone `vitest.config.ts` for test configuration

### 3. **Package Manager Issues**
**Problem:** pnpm was experiencing persistent network errors on Vercel's build infrastructure when fetching packages from npm registry.

**Solution:** Switched from pnpm to npm for Vercel deployments, which is more stable on Vercel's infrastructure.

## Files Modified

### `/vercel.json` (Created)
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "buildCommand": "cd crunchem && npm run build",
  "devCommand": "cd crunchem && npm run dev",
  "installCommand": "cd crunchem && npm install",
  "framework": "vite",
  "outputDirectory": "crunchem/dist"
}
```

### `/crunchem/vite.config.ts` (Simplified)
- Removed `vite-plugin-source-info` plugin
- Changed import from `vitest/config` to `vite`
- Removed test configuration (moved to separate file)

### `/crunchem/vitest.config.ts` (Created)
- Separated test configuration from Vite config
- Properly imports from `vitest/config`

### `/crunchem/package.json` (Updated)
- Updated `@vitejs/plugin-react` to `^5.0.0`
- Removed `vite-plugin-source-info` dependency
- Updated `postcss` version to `^8.4.49`
- Added `packageManager` field specifying `pnpm@9.0.0`

### `/crunchem/vercel.json` (Deleted)
- Removed conflicting configuration from subdirectory

**Latest Deployment:**
- State: READY
- Commit: "Switch to npm for Vercel deployment stability"

## Key Takeaways

1. **Monorepo Structure:** When your application is in a subdirectory, always configure `vercel.json` in the root with proper path commands.

2. **Dependency Compatibility:** Keep Vite plugins compatible with your Vite version. Vite 6 requires `@vitejs/plugin-react` v5+.

3. **Build Stability:** npm is generally more stable than pnpm on Vercel's infrastructure, especially when dealing with large dependency trees.

4. **Configuration Separation:** Keep build tool configs (vite.config.ts) separate from test tool configs (vitest.config.ts) to avoid type conflicts.

## Testing Locally

To test the build locally:
```bash
cd crunchem
npm install
npm run build
```

The build output will be in `crunchem/dist/`.
